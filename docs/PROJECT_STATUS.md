### Known Issues & Learnings

1. **Server Component Issues**

   - Problem: Class components in server context
   - Solution: Proper client/server separation
   - Learning: Always mark components using browser APIs as client components
   - Update: Successfully split services into client/server variants

2. **State Management**

   - Problem: Inconsistent state updates
   - Solution: Centralized state in ProfileClient
   - Learning: Keep state management close to data source
   - Update: Improved with dedicated client services

3. **Type Safety**

   - Problem: Optional chaining issues
   - Solution: Better type definitions and null checks
   - Learning: Define strict interfaces early
   - Update: Enhanced type definitions in client services

4. **Storage Persistence**

   - Problem: localStorage in SSR
   - Solution: Added isClient checks
   - Learning: Always consider server/client environment differences
   - Update: Properly separated client storage logic

5. **Translation Management**
   - Problem: Inconsistent translation handling
   - Solution: Centralized translations with server-side support
   - Learning: Handle translations at the appropriate layer
   - Update: Implemented hybrid client/server translation system

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**

   - Add comprehensive test coverage
   - Implement E2E tests
   - Add proper error handling tests
   - Test client/server service separation
   - Test translation system
   - Validate profile analytics

2. **Performance**

   - Profile NLP processing
   - Optimize storage operations
   - Add proper loading states
   - Monitor client-side processing impact
   - Optimize translation loading

3. **User Experience**

   - Add loading indicators
   - Improve error messages
   - Add success notifications
   - Enhance chat interface responsiveness
   - Improve language switching UX

4. **Code Quality**
   - Add proper documentation
   - Implement stricter TypeScript checks
   - Add proper logging
   - Document service separation patterns
   - Document translation system

## Technical Debt

1. **Testing**

   - Need unit tests for services
   - Need integration tests for components
   - Need E2E tests for main flows
   - Need tests for client/server interactions
   - Need translation coverage tests

2. **Error Handling**

   - Add proper error reporting
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - Add user-friendly error messages
   - Handle client-side failures gracefully
   - Improve translation fallbacks

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize NLP processing
   - Add proper caching
   - Implement proper loading states
   - Monitor client-side resource usage
   - Cache translations where appropriate

## Risks & Mitigation

1. **Browser Compatibility**

   - Risk: localStorage availability
   - Mitigation: Proper fallbacks and error handling
   - Update: Added client-side detection

2. **State Management**

   - Risk: Race conditions in updates
   - Mitigation: Proper state synchronization
   - Update: Improved with client service architecture

3. **Performance**

   - Risk: NLP processing time
   - Mitigation: Optimize and add loading states
   - Update: Split processing between client/server

4. **Internationalization**
   - Risk: Missing translations
   - Mitigation: Implemented fallback system
   - Update: Added server-side translation support

## Notes

- Focus on proper error handling
- Consider adding analytics for NLP accuracy
- Plan for proper test coverage
- Consider adding proper logging system
- Document client/server separation patterns
- Monitor client-side performance impact
- Track translation usage metrics
- Consider expanding language support
