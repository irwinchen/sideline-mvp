# Sideline MVP - Project Status

## Overview

**Project Start Date**: December 13, 2024
**Current Phase**: Week 1
**Project Status**: In Progress
**Last Updated**: December 13, 2024

## Recent Refactoring (Week 1)

### Completed Changes

1. **Client/Server Component Separation**

   - Created dedicated client services directory
   - Moved browser-dependent code to client components
   - Added proper "use client" directives
   - Fixed SSR compatibility issues

2. **Storage Service Enhancements**

   - Implemented local storage persistence
   - Added proper TypeScript typing
   - Improved error handling
   - Added safeguards for SSR environment

3. **NLP Service Improvements**

   - Enhanced confidence scoring
   - Added medical terminology recognition
   - Improved pattern matching
   - Added source tracking for restrictions

4. **Component Architecture**
   - Implemented proper state management in ProfileClient
   - Added error boundaries
   - Fixed React key warnings
   - Improved component type safety

### Current Features

- ✅ Enhanced NLP with confidence scoring
- ✅ Local storage persistence
- ✅ Improved error handling
- ✅ Better type safety
- ✅ SSR compatibility

### Known Issues & Learnings

1. **Server Component Issues**

   - Problem: Class components in server context
   - Solution: Proper client/server separation
   - Learning: Always mark components using browser APIs as client components

2. **State Management**

   - Problem: Inconsistent state updates
   - Solution: Centralized state in ProfileClient
   - Learning: Keep state management close to data source

3. **Type Safety**

   - Problem: Optional chaining issues
   - Solution: Better type definitions and null checks
   - Learning: Define strict interfaces early

4. **Storage Persistence**
   - Problem: localStorage in SSR
   - Solution: Added isClient checks
   - Learning: Always consider server/client environment differences

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**

   - Add comprehensive test coverage
   - Implement E2E tests
   - Add proper error handling tests

2. **Performance**

   - Profile NLP processing
   - Optimize storage operations
   - Add proper loading states

3. **User Experience**

   - Add loading indicators
   - Improve error messages
   - Add success notifications

4. **Code Quality**
   - Add proper documentation
   - Implement stricter TypeScript checks
   - Add proper logging

## Technical Debt

1. **Testing**

   - Need unit tests for services
   - Need integration tests for components
   - Need E2E tests for main flows

2. **Error Handling**

   - Add proper error reporting
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - Add user-friendly error messages

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize NLP processing
   - Add proper caching
   - Implement proper loading states

## Risks & Mitigation

1. **Browser Compatibility**

   - Risk: localStorage availability
   - Mitigation: Proper fallbacks and error handling

2. **State Management**

   - Risk: Race conditions in updates
   - Mitigation: Proper state synchronization

3. **Performance**
   - Risk: NLP processing time
   - Mitigation: Optimize and add loading states

## Notes

- Focus on proper error handling
- Consider adding analytics for NLP accuracy
- Plan for proper test coverage
- Consider adding proper logging system
