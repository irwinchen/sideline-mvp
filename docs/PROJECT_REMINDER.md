# Project: Sideline MVP - Development Reminder
Last Updated: December 13, 2024 16:15 UTC

## Core Development Rules [Updated: December 13, 2024 16:15 UTC]
1. **NO TRUNCATION - EVER**
   - Never use ellipsis (...) in code or documentation
   - Never use placeholders like [content remains the same]
   - Never write "rest of code remains same" or similar
   - Always write complete implementations
   - Never use "etc." or similar abbreviations
   - If referencing existing code, always show it in full
   - When showing file content, always include entire file
   - No partial updates or incomplete code blocks

## Framework Documentation & Debugging [Updated: December 13, 2024 16:15 UTC]
1. **Documentation References**
   - Always check current framework documentation when debugging
   - Use Brave search to find latest framework versions and updates
   - Verify documentation matches our framework versions:
     - Next.js 14
     - React 18
     - TypeScript 5.3
     - Tailwind CSS 3.3
     - shadcn/ui latest

2. **Debugging Process**
   - Start with framework documentation search
   - Use Brave search to find framework-specific issues
   - Check common patterns in framework repos
   - Example search workflow:
     ```
     1. Check error against framework docs
     2. Search framework GitHub issues
     3. Use Brave search with framework version
     4. Verify solutions against our version
     ```

3. **Framework Version Checking**
   - Document all framework versions in use
   - Check compatibility between versions
   - Keep track of breaking changes
   - Monitor framework updates
   - Test against latest versions

4. **Documentation Resources**
   - Next.js: https://nextjs.org/docs
   - React: https://react.dev/
   - TypeScript: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/
   - Tailwind: https://tailwindcss.com/docs
   - shadcn/ui: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs

5. **Search Strategies**
   - Include framework version in searches
   - Use framework-specific error codes
   - Search framework GitHub discussions
   - Check framework Discord/community
   - Verify solutions against our stack
